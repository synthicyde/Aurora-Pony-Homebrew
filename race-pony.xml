			<p class="flavor"><i>“They said I couldn't enter the tavern. I said nothing. I just stared until they moved the table outside.”</i><br />—Clovermane, pony warlock.</p>

			<p>Ponies are small, hardy quadrupeds known for their strength, spirit, and surprising wit. Though often underestimated as beasts of burden or pastoral companions, ponies in some realms possess intelligence equal to that of any speaking folk. Whether gifted by magic, born under auspicious stars, or simply descended from ancient lineages, these talking ponies defy expectation—and sometimes decorum.</p>

			<p>They range from shaggy mountain breeds to sleek meadow runners, and they come in many colors and personalities. While they lack hands, ponies make up for this with resilience, creativity, and sheer determination. A pony in your adventuring party might not climb a rope or scale a ladder, but they’ll haul you through a battlefield or trample a goblin without hesitation.</p>

			<p>Despite their unusual form, ponies are no strangers to society. Many travel with bards, druids, or eccentric nobles, and a few forge paths of their own, driven by curiosity, destiny, or just an unspoken promise to prove their worth.</p>
